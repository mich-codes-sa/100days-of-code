# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 09, 2023, Tuesday

**What I did at work:**

- Worked on migrating leave system to a different type of database.
- Worked on updating employee leave calculations.
- Added a different type of leave to the system.

**Today's Progress:**

- I started working on a Typescript CLI tutorial in preparation for a series of challenges issued by someone I follow on

**Thoughts:**

- I started working on a Typescript CLI tutorial in preparation for a series of challenges issued by someone I follow on LinkedIn. Had a bit of trouble getting the node-ts package installed and playing properly with the CLI tool I was writing.

**Resources used:**

- [Create A TS CLI](https://dev.to/raphaelmansuy/boost-your-productivity-by-creating-your-own-cli-command-with-typescript-part-1-5g37)

**Plans for tomorrow:**

- Finish the CLI tutorial and start working on the challenge.
- Initialise pomodoro timer project that I'm going to be working on (React Native);
