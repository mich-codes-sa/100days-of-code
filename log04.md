# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: May 13, 2023, Saturday

**What I did at work:**

- Nothing. It's Saturday, and I don't work over the weekend.

**Today's Progress:**

- A little bit of work on the Meta Frontend Developer Certification on Coursera.
- Work on a TDD todo list/habit tracker.

**Thoughts:**

- Completing the Meta Frontend Certificate will hopefully increase my confidence and bring me some validation in my abilities. It'll also be good for future recruiters when they see it as a verified credential on LinkedIn.
- TDD is something that provides some nice guardrails for a project, but I don't want to be completely bound by it. A lot of the problems that TDD solves can be solved by strong typing.

**Resources used:**

- [Create your own CLI with Typescript](https://dev.to/raphaelmansuy/boost-your-productivity-by-creating-your-own-cli-command-with-typescript-part-1-5g37)
- [Coursera - Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)

**Plans for tomorrow:**

- Finish PHP habit tracker.
- Start working on React Native pomodoro timer.
- Continue working on my portfolio. I want to get that sorted before moving on to any other major projects.
