# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 10, 2023, Wednesday

**What I did at work:**

- Set up my new computer development environment. Linking databases etc.
- Started familiarising myself with the codebase for an ecommerce platform I'm being brought onto.
- Looked at the code for another project I'm being brought onto.

**Today's Progress:**

- Built out a basic header for my new portfolio in Codux. I'm quite excited to see the project become what I envision for it.
- Deployed my project to Vercel. It's going to take a bit of work, but a portfolio revamp is really needed.

**Thoughts:**

- Codux is a bit of a mission to set up, and it doesn't work with all the tooling I'd usually for a project, but for now it can still be super useful for getting the UI of a project sorted. Once that's done, I can then migrate the components into a more fully featured project repo.
- It's important to check the code that Codux is producing in a browser, because it won't always look exactly like it does in the Codux editor.

**Resources used:**

- [Codux](https://www.codux.com/)

**Plans for tomorrow:**

- Finish Work on CLI tool from log00. I'm thinking the issue might be with my old machine.
- Initialise pomodoro timer project that I'm going to be working on (React Native).
