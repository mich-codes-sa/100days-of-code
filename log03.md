# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: May 12, 2023, Friday

**What I did at work:**

- Started contributing to the ecommerce platform for the first time. Made some changes to the way emails are sent, and changed the system to show the company name instead of the salesperson's name. 

**Today's Progress:**

- Made some minor changes to my portfolio project, and found someone who built their portfolio from the same design files as me. Going to be looking at how they put their site together for inspiration.
- A little bit of work on the Meta Frontend Developer Certification on Coursera.
- Did some more work on TDD todo list/habit tracker.

**Thoughts:**

- The design of my portfolio is really great, and seeing it fully implemented inspired me to continue working on it, because it'll be super impressive once it's done.
- I'm still doing the course in audit mode, so I don't have full access to the course, but I'd like to possibly apply for financial aid, because paying for things in dollars is prohibitively expensive.
- Once I've finished working on this version, I'd like to create a similar project using the t3 stack.

**Resources used:**

- [Coursera - Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)
- [T3 stack documentation](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction)

**Plans for tomorrow:**

- Finish up TDD todo/habit tracker in PHP.
- Continue working on my portfolio.
