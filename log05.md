# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: May 14, 2023, Sunday

**What I did at work:**

- Nothing. It's Sunday, and I don't work over the weekend.

**Today's Progress:**

- A little bit of work on the Meta Frontend Developer Certification on Coursera.
- Work on a TDD todo list/habit tracker.

**Thoughts:**

- The Meta frontend dev certificate is mostly going over content that I've already learned, but it is a valuable review of the content, and I'm looking forward to getting to the content that will be new for me. I haven't learned bootstrap before, so that will be brand new content.
- The tests that I'm writing for this project don't catch everything. There's something funky going on with the design, but all the tests are passing, so I need to figure out why that's happening.

**Resources used:**

- [TDD Habit tracker](https://github.com/tuto1902/habit-tracker)
- [Coursera - Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)

**Plans for tomorrow:**

- Finish PHP habit tracker.
- Start working on React Native pomodoro timer.
- Continue working on my portfolio. I want to get that sorted before moving on to any other major projects.
