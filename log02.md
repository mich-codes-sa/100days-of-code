# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: May 11, 2023, Thursday

**What I did at work:**

- More dev environment setup on my new machine. I had to set up NVM, which is a pretty cool tool that allows you to switch between different Node versions depending on your needs.

**Today's Progress:**

- Finished work on first ts-cli tool. Will look at completing the challenge tomorrow.
- Initialised pomodoro timer project that I'm going to be working on (React Native).
- A little bit of work on the Meta Frontend Developer Certification on Coursera.
- Started work on a TDD todo list/habit tracker.

**Thoughts:**

- Adding some basic knowledge about how to build a CLI will definitely help building out different features that might come in handy and will potentially allow me to create my own dev tooling going forwards.
- Adding React native to my toolbelt will be a strong positive. I'm going to continue working toward creating an app that I feel confident deploying to the app store and adding to my portfolio.
- Completing the Meta Frontend Certificate will hopefully increase my confidence and bring me some validation in my abilities. It'll also be good for future recruiters when they see it as a verified credential on LinkedIn.
- TDD is something that provides some nice guardrails for a project, but I don't want to be completely bound by it. A lot of the problems that TDD solves can be solved by strong typing.

**Resources used:**

- [Create your own CLI with Typescript](https://dev.to/raphaelmansuy/boost-your-productivity-by-creating-your-own-cli-command-with-typescript-part-1-5g37)
- [Coursera - Meta Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer)

**Plans for tomorrow:**

- Work on CLI tool challenge.
- Continue working on my portfolio. I want to get that sorted before moving on to any other major projects.
